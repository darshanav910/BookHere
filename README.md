# BookHere

The project is a php based website. It can handle all the requests from the Internet and responds to it accordingly.We have developed a website for online book shopping. The students had to wander different stationeries to buy a book. The problem is when a book is not available and If it is available then the price might be unaffordable. So this website will show the books available in different stationeries with different prices and categories. So user can compare the prices and also buy online easily.
